          <div class="box"> Henri Lefebvre talks about the ideas behind the Architecture of Hip-Hop having three main purposes: music, space, and architecture. Lefebvre talks about how there is space between architecture and hip-hop. He talks about how the black community can be adaptive to build a pond its structures of demand of availability for materials. This means that people will take the time to find the missing piece in their life. Lefebvre quotes Laverne Wells-Bowie by saying that ‚Äúas architecture as a cultural practice‚Ä¶the scene of architecture acknowledging the diversity of location, that wherever folks are dwelling in space, they can think creatively about the transformation and reinvention of that space‚Äù (Lefebvre 13). In his essay, Lefebvre wants his readers to know that they should be thinking outside the box within their space to solve problems in their lives. They should think creatively about how to make something better. </div>
