          <div class="box"> Hip-Hop architecture can even be preprimary of black identity. Performers and everyday people should be able to identity how music is created by listening to how the musicians performs the song. The palimpsestic of hip-hop architecture can influence the way people approach the music itself. For instance, people listening to rap can be influenced to have sex, do drugs, and join a gang. Degradation and discrimination make people uneasy to be themselves, go down a dark path that can make them do wrong. The rap community is presented as the black community. This honestly is so wrong to think about that when we hear rap music, peopleâ€™s minds instantly go to the black community even though people in the white community do rap too. For instance, Eminem is well known in hip-hop, and people have discriminated against him for years for being a white rapper. He is the most unappreciated white rapper out there.  </div>
