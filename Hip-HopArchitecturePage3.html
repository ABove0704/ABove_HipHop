           <div class="box"> Lefebvre talks about how sound formats the way social formation is presented to black communities around the world. He wants readers to understand that pop and rock influence the way ‚Äúboys and girls learn their repertoire of public sexual behaviors‚Äù (Lefebvre 7). People can become influenced by the lyrics of hard rock to help ease the tension between each partner while having sex. Lefebvre says pop and rock music is for viewers to find their identity. This is true because people adrenaline raises when they are listening to hardcore music that is ringing in their ears. Lefebvre even goes into that music creates interactions and space among the black community. This is a fact because the space people are in helps them find themselves with music to create memories for people in social groups.  </div>
