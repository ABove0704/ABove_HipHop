           <div class="box" style="font-size: 14px;"> Lefebvre defines social space as both works which are the interaction and product which is what is created by the interaction. He wants his readers to understand that social interactions happen by creating a space for social gatherings. He wants the black community to have conversations within their space to understand what that person is going through. Space and music are not static because there are always interactions going on with hip-hop and people around the world. Lefebvre states three ideas of having interactions with others, having memories in the past, present, and future, make a conclusion with others. He stresses that people should have memories of each other but should know the outcome of those memories. Hip-hop has left a lasting impression on people around the world and people need to realize that memories last forever. Lefebvre wants everyone to know that there is space between music and architecture. The black community always gets under depreciate and called out for being racists with their slogan music in hip-hop and rap. People need to appreciate every community no matter what color and race they are. Hip-Hop architecture will leave lasting memories for generations ahead for the black community even though they donâ€™t get looked upon as often as they should.  </div>
